# Chapter 11: Nav2 for Biped Movement

## Path Planning
Nav2 provides advanced algorithms for path planning in biped robots. It calculates optimal routes that consider robot dynamics, environmental constraints, and safety margins.

## Localization
Accurate localization ensures that the robot knows its position within the environment. Nav2 combines odometry, VSLAM, and sensor data to maintain precise localization during movement.

## Mapping
Nav2 supports real-time map building and updating. Biped robots can create occupancy maps, semantic maps, and topological maps to navigate efficiently in indoor and outdoor environments.

## Navigating Stairs and Obstacles
Biped robots face unique challenges like stairs and uneven terrain. Nav2 includes specialized modules to handle stair climbing, obstacle detection, and dynamic replanning to ensure smooth and safe navigation.
