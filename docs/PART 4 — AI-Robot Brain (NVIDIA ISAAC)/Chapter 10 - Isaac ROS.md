# Chapter 10: Isaac ROS

## Hardware-Accelerated Perception
Isaac ROS provides hardware acceleration for perception tasks using NVIDIA GPUs. This allows robots to process large sensor data streams, such as camera and LiDAR inputs, in real time with low latency.

## VSLAM
Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is used to build maps and track the robot’s position simultaneously. Isaac ROS integrates VSLAM modules that leverage GPU acceleration for robust and fast localization in complex environments.

## Navigation Stack
The navigation stack in Isaac ROS allows robots to plan paths and move safely in dynamic environments. It includes modules for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and motion control, which are optimized for biped and wheeled robots.

## Camera, Depth, and LiDAR Integration
Isaac ROS supports multiple sensor types, including RGB cameras, depth cameras, and LiDAR sensors. Sensor fusion techniques combine these data streams to improve perception accuracy, enabling reliable obstacle detection, mapping, and navigation.
