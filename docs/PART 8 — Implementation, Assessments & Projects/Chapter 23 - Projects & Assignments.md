# Chapter 23: Projects & Assignments

## ROS 2 Package Creation
Students will create custom ROS 2 packages for controlling humanoid robots. This includes defining nodes, topics, services, and launch files. Packages serve as modular components for simulation and real-world deployment.

## Gazebo Simulation Project
Using Gazebo, students will simulate robot models and environments. This project includes implementing navigation, perception, and manipulation tasks, testing them in virtual scenarios before hardware deployment.

## Isaac Perception Pipeline
Students will build a perception pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The pipeline includes sensor integration, data processing, and AI-based perception models for tasks like object detection, segmentation, and tracking.

## VLA Voice-Controlled Robot
Students will develop a voice-controlled humanoid robot using Vision-Language-Action systems. The robot will receive spoken commands, interpret them using NLP, and execute tasks autonomously.

## Final Humanoid Project
The final project combines all skills: ROS 2, simulation, perception, planning, manipulation, and voice control. Students will design a humanoid robot capable of completing complex tasks in simulated or real-world environments.
