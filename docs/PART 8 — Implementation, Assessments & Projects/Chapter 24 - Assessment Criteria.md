# Chapter 24: Assessment Criteria

## Coding Performance
Evaluate the quality, readability, and efficiency of ROS 2 nodes, scripts, and configuration files. Proper documentation and modular design are also assessed.

## Simulation Accuracy
Assess how accurately the robot performs tasks in simulation, including navigation, manipulation, and interaction with the environment. This includes adherence to planned trajectories and task completion.

## AI Integration
Evaluate the integration of AI models for perception, planning, and decision-making. The robot should demonstrate the ability to process sensor data and execute intelligent actions autonomously.

## Human-Robot Interaction Design
Assess the usability, safety, and effectiveness of human-robot interaction, including voice commands, gesture recognition, and task execution. The robot should interact intuitively with humans while maintaining reliability and safety.
