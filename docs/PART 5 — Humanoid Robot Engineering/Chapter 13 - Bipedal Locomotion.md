# Chapter 13: Bipedal Locomotion

## Walking Gaits
Bipedal locomotion involves generating walking gaits, which define the sequence of leg movements. Common gaits include static walking (slow and stable) and dynamic walking (faster with momentum control).

## Balance Restoration
Robots must continuously adjust their posture to restore balance, especially after perturbations. Techniques like feedback control and inertial measurement corrections are used to maintain stability.

## Leg Trajectory Planning
Trajectory planning defines the path that each leg follows during walking. This includes foot placement, swing trajectories, and step timing, optimized to minimize energy consumption and maintain balance.

## Fall Prevention & Recovery
Humanoid robots implement fall detection and recovery strategies. This includes predicting instability, adjusting posture, and executing safe recovery motions to prevent damage and continue operation.
