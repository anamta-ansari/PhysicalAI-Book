# Chapter 14: Grasping and Manipulation

## Humanoid Hand Mechanics
Humanoid hands are designed to mimic human dexterity. They include multiple fingers, joints, and actuators to enable fine manipulation and complex grasping tasks.

## Object Detection
Robots use vision sensors, depth cameras, and tactile feedback to detect and localize objects in their environment. Accurate detection is essential for planning grasp actions.

## Grasp Planning
Grasp planning involves computing the optimal hand pose and finger configuration to securely hold an object. This includes considering object shape, weight, and surface friction.

## Pick-and-Place in Real World
Using perception, planning, and control, humanoid robots execute pick-and-place tasks. This integrates all previous topics, allowing robots to interact with real-world objects reliably.
