# Chapter 22: Cloud-Native Robotics (Ether Lab)

## AWS RoboMaker
AWS RoboMaker provides cloud-based simulation and deployment for ROS 2 robots. It allows scaling, collaboration, and testing without local hardware limitations.

## NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud
Omniverse Cloud enables real-time collaboration in simulation and AI development. Multiple users and robots can interact in the same virtual environment.

## Sim-to-Real with Cloud Training
Simulation environments in the cloud allow training AI models before deployment to real robots. Techniques like domain randomization ensure robust transfer from simulation to reality.

## Latency Challenges
Cloud-based robotics introduces latency due to network transmission. Solutions include edge-cloud hybrid architectures, predictive modeling, and real-time streaming optimization to ensure safe robot operation.
