# Chapter 21: Robot Lab Architecture

## Unitree Go2
A quadruped robot used for locomotion research and mobility experiments. It is lightweight and modular, ideal for lab testing.

## Unitree G1 Humanoid
A humanoid robot platform used for advanced bipedal locomotion experiments and AI integration tests. Supports ROS 2 and various sensors.

## Robot Arms as Proxies
Robot arms can serve as manipulators for tasks like object grasping, pick-and-place experiments, or proxy demonstrations of humanoid hand functions.

## Mini Humanoids (OP3, Hiwonder)
Small humanoid robots are useful for low-cost experimentation and teaching purposes. They allow testing of motion, perception, and learning algorithms on a scaled platform.
