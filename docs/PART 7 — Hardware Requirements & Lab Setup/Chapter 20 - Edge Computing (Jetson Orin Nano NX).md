# Chapter 20: Edge Computing (Jetson Orin Nano/NX)

## Why Edge AI Matters
Edge AI allows robots to process data locally without relying on cloud servers. This reduces latency, ensures real-time responsiveness, and maintains privacy for sensitive data.

## Deploying ROS Nodes on Jetson
Robotic nodes, including perception, navigation, and control modules, can be deployed directly on NVIDIA Jetson devices. This allows low-power, high-efficiency operation in the field.

## Sensor Integration: RealSense D435i, IMU, Microphones
Edge devices integrate multiple sensors:
- **RealSense D435i** for depth and visual perception.
- **IMU** for orientation and motion tracking.
- **Microphones** for voice command reception and audio processing.
Sensor fusion ensures accurate and reliable robot perception.
