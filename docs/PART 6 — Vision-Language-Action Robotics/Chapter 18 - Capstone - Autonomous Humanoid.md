# Chapter 18: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

## Receive Voice Command
The humanoid robot receives natural language instructions through a microphone array and converts them into textual commands using speech recognition models.

## Plan Task
The robot uses planning algorithms and LLM reasoning to generate a sequence of actions that satisfy the command. This includes mapping the task to available skills and environmental constraints.

## Navigate Environment
Autonomous navigation modules allow the robot to move safely in dynamic environments. The robot avoids obstacles, climbs stairs, and chooses optimal paths to complete tasks efficiently.

## Identify Object
Vision and sensor systems identify and locate objects relevant to the task. Techniques include object detection, segmentation, and multi-modal perception.

## Manipulate It
The robot executes grasping and manipulation actions based on the object’s size, shape, and position. This combines motion planning, force control, and trajectory optimization.

## Complete Action Autonomously
Finally, the robot monitors task completion and handles errors, adapting its behavior to achieve the goal without human intervention. This demonstrates a fully autonomous humanoid capable of completing real-world tasks.
