# Chapter 16: Voice-to-Action

## Using OpenAI Whisper
OpenAI Whisper is a speech recognition system that converts human speech into text. In robotics, Whisper allows robots to receive voice commands accurately even in noisy environments.

## Converting Speech to Commands
After speech is transcribed, the system parses commands to extract intent and actions. This process translates human instructions into structured robotic tasks, enabling seamless voice-controlled operation.

## Natural Language Understanding
Robots use NLP models to interpret semantics, context, and task-specific instructions. This includes resolving ambiguities and understanding references like "the nearest object" or "on the table."

## Safety in Voice Control
Voice-controlled robots implement safety protocols to prevent unintended actions. This includes verifying commands, obstacle detection, and emergency stop mechanisms to ensure safe operation.
