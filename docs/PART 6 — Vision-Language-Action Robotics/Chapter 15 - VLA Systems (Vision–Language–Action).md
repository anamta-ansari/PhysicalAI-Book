# Chapter 15: VLA Systems (Vision–Language–Action)

## What is VLA?
VLA (Vision–Language–Action) systems integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic actions. These systems allow robots to interpret commands, perceive their environment, and perform complex tasks autonomously.

## Combining Vision + Language + Action
VLA systems process inputs from cameras and sensors (vision), interpret textual or spoken commands (language), and convert them into executable motor actions (action). This integration enables robots to follow instructions like "pick up the red ball" in unstructured environments.

## Benchmark Models
Several benchmark models are used to evaluate VLA systems. These include multi-modal transformers and reinforcement learning-based models that map visual inputs and language commands to actions.

## Multi-modal Perception
Multi-modal perception combines visual, auditory, and sometimes tactile data to understand context and environment. This allows robots to make informed decisions and perform tasks reliably even in dynamic or cluttered environments.
