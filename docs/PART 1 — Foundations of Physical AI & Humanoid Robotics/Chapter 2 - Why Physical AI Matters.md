# Chapter 2: Why Physical AI Matters

## AI in the physical world vs virtual world
Physical AI operates in unpredictable, dynamic environments, requiring adaptation and real-time decision-making compared to controlled virtual AI.

## Importance of human-centered design in robotics
Designing robots around human needs ensures safety, usability, and effective collaboration.

## How humanoids adapt to our world
Humanoid robots use sensors and AI to navigate, manipulate objects, and interact socially in human environments.

## Data abundance from real-world interactions
Robots generate vast amounts of sensor and interaction data that improve AI learning and decision-making.

## Future of work: humans + AI agents + robots
Collaboration between humans, AI agents, and robots will enhance productivity, safety, and innovation in various industries.
