# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI is the branch of artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world. Unlike digital AI, it must sense, act, and adapt to real-world environments.

## Difference between digital AI vs physical AI
- **Digital AI**: Operates in virtual or digital spaces, analyzing data and making predictions.
- **Physical AI**: Embodied in robots or devices, interacting directly with the environment.

## Embodied intelligence: AI inside a body
Embodied intelligence is the concept where AI has a physical body, allowing it to perceive and act in the world. The body provides feedback that enhances learning.

## Why AI needs physical awareness (gravity, friction, torque)
To perform tasks effectively, AI must account for forces like gravity, friction, and torque, ensuring safe and efficient motion.

## History and evolution of humanoid robotics
From early automata to modern robots like ASIMO, Atlas, and Tesla Optimus, humanoid robotics has evolved in complexity, mobility, and AI integration.

## Current humanoid robot industry (Unitree, Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics)
Companies like Unitree, Boston Dynamics, and Tesla are developing humanoid robots for mobility, dexterity, and real-world applications.
