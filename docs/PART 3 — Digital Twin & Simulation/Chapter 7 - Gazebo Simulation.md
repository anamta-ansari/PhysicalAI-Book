# Chapter 7: Gazebo Simulation

## Introduction to Gazebo
Gazebo is a simulation tool for robots in realistic environments.

## Setting up simulation environment
Includes installation, configuration, and integration with ROS 2.

## SDF vs URDF
- **SDF**: Simulation Description Format for Gazebo
- **URDF**: Robot Description for ROS

## Physics simulation
Simulates gravity, friction, collisions, and other physical phenomena.

## Collision handling and inertia
Ensures realistic interactions and stability in simulation.

## Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth cameras, IMU
Replicate real-world sensor behavior in the simulated environment.

## Testing locomotion in simulation
Evaluate robot movement, stability, and control strategies.
