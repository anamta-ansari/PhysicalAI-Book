# Chapter 5: ROS 2 Development with Python

## Creating ROS 2 packages
Packages are the building blocks of ROS 2 projects containing nodes, scripts, and configuration.

## Writing publishers and subscribers
Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive them.

## Launch files
Launch files automate starting multiple nodes and setting parameters.

## Parameters and configurations
Parameters configure node behavior dynamically at runtime.

## rclpy for robot control
`rclpy` is the Python client library for ROS 2, enabling node creation and communication.

## Debugging ROS 2 applications
Debugging tools and logging help identify and fix issues in ROS 2 programs.
