# Chapter 4: Introduction to ROS 2

## What is ROS 2 and why it’s important
ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a framework for robot software development, providing tools for communication, control, and simulation.

## ROS 2 architecture
ROS 2 uses a modular, distributed architecture with nodes, topics, services, and actions.

## Nodes
Nodes are individual processes that perform computation in ROS 2.

## Topics
Topics enable publish-subscribe communication between nodes.

## Services
Services provide request-response communication between nodes.

## Actions
Actions handle long-running tasks with feedback and results.

## Message passing
Nodes communicate using messages sent over topics, services, or actions.

## ROS 2 graph
The ROS 2 graph represents the runtime network of nodes, topics, services, and actions.
